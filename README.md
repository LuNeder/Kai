# Kai
Kai automatically splits a big text into multiple chunks with exactly 500 characters (for Mastodon) and 280 characters (for Twitter), automatically numbering them with your layout choice, and then toots and tweets them into a mastodon and twitter thread.

# Usage
Write the text you want to toot and/or tweet on the "tweet" file.

# Configuration and Layout
### Layout Files
The layout configuration consists of 4 files, all of them optional:
<!--
- firstpre: What will be on the first tweet only, at the start. Usually a title or just left empty.
-->
- thpre: What will be at the start of each tweet of the thread. Usually a "...".
- thpost: What will be on the end of each tweet. Usually a "..." and a number, such as "2/4" indicating what tweet you're on and until what tweet the thread goes.
- lastpost: Like thpost, but for the last tweet.
As an alternative, you could delete all layout config files to just split and tweet the text with no thread numbering or anything.
### Configuration files
- platform: "m" for Mastodon, "t" for twitter, "mt" for both. If you use some kind of automatic crossposter, itâ€™s recommended to use Kai with only one of the platforms and then let the crossposter do its job.
##### Twitter:
- apikey:
- apisecret:
- apitoken:
- tokensecret:
<!--
- twtuser: 
-->
##### Mastodon:
- mastaccesstoken: 
### Variables
The following variables can be added to the above files and will be automatically changed by Kai.
<!--
- %?: Title
- %u: @username of who's tweeting (defined in configuration files)
-->
- %nu: Number of the current tweet on the thread
  - %n can also be used, but only for threads with less than 100 tweets
- %TO: Total number of tweets on the thread
  - %T can also be used, but only for threads with less than 100 tweets
# Limitations
- A thread with 1000 tweets or more might not come out as expected if using %nu and/or %TO on layout
